# Atlanta_crimedata
We will have explored the trends in crime data for the city of Atlanta. We were interested to see the relationship between crime and neighborhoods through household income. We also be analyzed the types of crimes happening and when they are most likely to occur. This topic is something that is relevant for all of us, and can give us some insight on a topic that affects all of our daily lives.
Our hypothesis was  neighborhoods with lower median home income see  statistically significant higher crime rates.
The data we obtained included over 26,000 data points that include:
•	Time and date of crime
•	Specific charge 
•	Street Address
•	Neighborhood



We used, Python, Pandas, gmaps, numpy, scipy, JSONs and API's
